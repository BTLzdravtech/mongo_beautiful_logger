Amazing, right? ðŸ˜ƒ

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mongo_beautiful_logger'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mongo_beautiful_logger

## Usage

To use Mongo Beautiful Logger as you default mongo logger, create a configuration file, and fill it with the following:
```ruby
require "mongo_beautiful_logger"

# MongoDB Driver:
Mongo::Logger.logger = MongoBeautifulLogger.new($stdout)

# Mongoid ODM:
Mongoid.logger = MongoBeautifulLogger.new($stdout)
```

The MongoidBeautifulLogger class takes unlimited parameters which specify multiple output destinations. This can be used to output logs to a file as well as the console:
```ruby
MongoBeautifulLogger.new($stdout, 'log.txt')
```

## Behavior

Mongo Beautiful logger automatically colors all mongodb actions (find, update, insert, delete, aggregate, error, endsession, failure). It will also filter out the redundant messages regarding topology events, and server description changes. If there are any other actions that you would like to be customized, you can open a [github issue](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/mongo_beautiful_logger/issues/new), or submit a pull request. Any contribution is greatly appreciated.
